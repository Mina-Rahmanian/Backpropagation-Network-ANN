# Backpropagation Network ANN
<br />

Useful bits of knowledge before start:
+ First of all, please read The Artificial Neural Networks book in second edition from this link ["Elements of Artificial Neural Networks" ](https://www.academia.edu/23714658/Elements_of_Artificial_Neural_Networks). 
+ There are absolutely free resources for Deep Learning (online book) in [Here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html).
+  Also if you want to work Convolutional network you can read this link [Convolutional network](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/) too. 
<br /><br /><br />


## Data MNIST handwritten digit Description

+ You will use the handwritten character database for this practice by Lecunet al available at the following [here](https://github.com/Mina-Rahmanian/Backpropagation-Network-ANN/blob/main/MNIST%20handwritten%20digit%20database%2C%20Yann%20LeCun%2C%20Corinna%20Cortes%20an.pdf).
+ Four files are available as bellow written:

| Files                     | Data Size   | Task                               | 
| --------------------------|-------|:----------------------------------:|

|[train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz](https://github.com/Mina-Rahmanian/Backpropagation-Network-ANN/blob/main/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz)               | 28881 bytes  | training set labels         | 
|[t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz](https://github.com/Mina-Rahmanian/Backpropagation-Network-ANN/blob/main/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz)               | 1648877 bytes  | test set images |
|[t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz](https://github.com/Mina-Rahmanian/Backpropagation-Network-ANN/blob/main/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz)  |   4542 bytes   |   test set labels                             |<br /><br />


+ MNIST dataset can also be loaded directly in Python using packages such as Kerasand scikit-learn.<br />
